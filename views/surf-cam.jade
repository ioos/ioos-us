        h2 Live Surf Camera
        p Surfline and IOOS have joined forces to bring you a literal eye on the ocean.
        p Under a cooperative research and development agreement, or CRADA, signed in 2017, Surfline began mounting live surf cameras on high-frequency radar installations within the U.S. IOOS network along the Atlantic coast. This public-private partnership teams up existing resources on both sides to expand the utility of the radar installations and the information available to Surfline users.
        p The first installation to receive a camera was along the New Jersey coast with more cameras being added in the future.
        p The embedded video below is streaming from one of the CRADA locations.
